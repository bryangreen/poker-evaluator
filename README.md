# Poker Hand Evaluator

A poker hand evaluator built with [Angular2](https://angular.io/) and
[TypeScript 1.8](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). Its goal is to
evaluate any hand and output its poker rank.

## Build

From the root directory of this app, run the command:

```
npm run-script build
```

_Additional scripts can be found in the package.json file in
the project root._

## Development server

From the root directory of this app, run the command:

```
npm run-script server-debug
```

This will start the
[webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
and automatically as changes are made to the source files.

Point your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Running tests

### Unit/integration testing

From the root directory of this app, run the command:

```
npm run-script test
```

The [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) test runner
is used in conjunction with the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test
framework and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assertion library.

### End-to-end testing

From the root directory of this app, run the commands:

```
npm run-script webdriver-update
npm run-script webdriver-setup
npm run-script test-e2e
```

These tests run using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) and
are written with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/).


## Coding guidelines

The naming and coding conventions use the
[TypeScript StyleGuide and Coding Conventions](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/styleguide/styleguide.html) guide.

Important distinctions include:
 
- Interfaces use the suffix _Interface_.

## Next steps and lessons learned
- Consider building from scratch using the
  [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) tool. This would at
  least make deployment to GitHub pages easier along with blueprints for
  creating components, services, classes, etc.
- Use json files to describe rank, suit, hand rankings. Here's an
  example describing the _Royal Flush_ hand ranking:
```json
{		
	"name": "Royal Flush",	
	"rank": 1,	
	"formula": {	
		"isSequence": true,
		"isSameSuit": true,
		"sameTwoRank": 0,
		"sameThreeRank": 0,
		"sameFourRank": 0,
		"requiredCard": "Ace",
		"tieBreaker": ""
	}	
}

```
or a command-driven approach:
```json
{		
	"name": "Royal Flush",	
	"rank": 1,	
	"requirements": [{	
		"name": "isSequence",
		"value": true
	}, {	
		"name": "isSameSuit",
		"value": true
	}, {	
		"name": "requiredCard",
		"value": "Ace"
	}]	
}

```
